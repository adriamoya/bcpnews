# Classifying news articles to build a tailored newsletter

Real case application for a financial consulting firm.

For over more than two years, an experienced employee from this firm collected the most relevant press articles from different newspapers each day. The goal was spreading a tailored, daily newsletter to all employees with interesting news about the financial and economic landscape (with both national and international scope). This process could take up to 2 hours every day and comprise task such as reading multiple newspaper front pages, keep track of cross-cutting topics from other sectors, structuring and ranking articles and manually writing and sending the newsletter.
